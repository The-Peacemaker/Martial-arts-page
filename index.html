                    <p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Karate, originating from Okinawa, Japan, is an ‚Äúempty hand‚Äù martial art focused on powerful strikes, blocks, and disciplined movement. It blends ancient Chinese influences with native Okinawan techniques. Training is divided into kihon (fundamental techniques), kata (pre-arranged forms that encode self-defense principles), and kumite (sparring). Karate emphasizes direct linear power, sharp technique, and mental composure, with a strong focus on etiquette and personal development.</p>
                    <p><strong>History & Philosophy:</strong> Karate was shaped by centuries of cultural exchange and the need for self-defense among Okinawan peasants. Its philosophy centers on self-control, respect, and the pursuit of perfection in technique and character. The dojo kun (training hall rules) guide practitioners to act with integrity and humility both inside and outside the dojo.</p>
                    <p><strong>Training Benefits:</strong> Builds hip-driven kinetic chain, posture integrity, joint stability, and explosive fast-twitch power. Karate develops spatial awareness, reaction speed, and decisive execution. Philosophically, it cultivates respect, humility, and self‚Äëregulation under pressure, aiming for peace and self-mastery rather than aggression.</p>
