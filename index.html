                 techniques makes ITMA a holistic and comprehensive martial art, promoting physical fitness, mental focus, and self-defense capabilities.

            <p>Kalaripayattu is one of the oldest and most revered martial arts in India,
                 originating in the state of Kerala over 3,000 years ago. It combines striking,

                  as "kolthari" (stick fighting) and "ankathari" (sword and shield). Besides combat training, 
                  Kalaripayattu also incorporates elements of meditation and healing, focusing on both mental 
                  discipline and physical health. It is not just a martial art but a holistic system that balances
                   the mind, body, and spirit, with practitioners learning to respect discipline, harmony, and control.

            <h4>5. MUAY THAI </h4>

                  Training centers for Jujutsu and BJJ are spreading across cities like Mumbai and Delhi, with both adults and young

                  self-defense applications. Its resurgence in recent years has been fueled by efforts to preserve
                   Indian heritage and a growing interest in traditional martial arts. </p>

           
                   
                   <h4>8. KICKBOXING  </h4>
           <p>Kickboxing has become increasingly popular in India in recent years, thanks to a growing

              The sport is also being introduced in schools and fitness centers, enabling youth to

               realize the benefits of kickboxing, it is gradually gaining recognition within India's martial arts community. </p>

              <h4>9. MMA  </h4>
           <p>Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) has witnessed a meteoric rise in popularity in India over the past decade, particularly 
            with the establishment of regional leagues and international broadcasts. The sport, which blends various fighting 
            techniques such as wrestling, jiu-jitsu, and striking arts, has captured the imagination of young Indians looking 
            for a challenging and dynamic sport. Prominent MMA organizations, like the Super Fight League (SFL) and Brave Combat
             Federation, have provided Indian fighters with opportunities to compete on the global stage. As MMA gyms proliferate
              across the country, a new generation of athletes is emerging, eager to make their mark in the sport. This growth in
               MMA is also contributing to India's overall athletic culture, encouraging youth to embrace discipline and fitness. </p>

              <h4>10. AIKIDO  </h4>
           <p>Aikido, a Japanese martial art that emphasizes harmony and non-violent self-defense, has a niche but dedicated following in India.
             It focuses on redirecting an opponent's energy and using their force against them, rather than relying on brute strength,
              which appeals to those interested in a more philosophical approach to combat. Though not as mainstream as other martial 
              arts in India, Aikido has gained a steady following through specialized dojos and international training camps.
               Enthusiasts often appreciate Aikido for its mental and spiritual benefits, with its teachings fostering inner peace
                and balance. As awareness of Aikido grows, it is gradually finding its place among India's diverse martial arts
                 community.</p>
